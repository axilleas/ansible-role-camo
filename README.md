ansible-role-camo
=========

The only requirement is `nodejs`. For RHEL/CentOS you must enable the EPEL
repository.

Role Variables
--------------

Camo recieves user defined settings with environmental variables as seen in
<https://github.com/atmos/camo/tree/master#configuration>. You can find their
default values in `defaults/main.yml` which are then loaded via the template
`camo.env.j2` in systemd service.

The only required variable is `camo_key`.
